# An impementation of Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm for Traveling Salesman Problem

Although ants as an individuals have a very limited cognitive capabilities as it was proven in many studies, as a population they are capable of performing very complicated tasks efficiently. 

As a signal transmitter for communication, ants use chemical substances called pheromones. Corresponding to message an ant wants to transmit there is specific pheromone. Ant communicate by leaving trail of pheromone in the environment. The messages are simple e.g. alarm, food, aviod. This mechanism of coordination of individual action is called stigmergy and is not specific to ants.

An example of how efficient in solving problems this simple mechanism can be is shortest path problem. In real life ant face the problem of finding the most efficient routes between nest and food. It turns out that the paths formed by ants are often near optimal.
